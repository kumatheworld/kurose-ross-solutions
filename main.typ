+ A host and an end system are the same thing. Phones or laptops connected to the Internet are examples of end systems. A Web server is also an end system.
+ #quote(block: true, attribution: link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(diplomacy)"))[Protocol is commonly described as a set of international courtesy rules. These well-established and time-honored rules have made it easier for nations and people to live and work together. Part of protocol has always been the acknowledgment of the hierarchical standing of all present. Protocol rules are based on the principles of civility.â€”Dr. P.M. Forni on behalf of the International Association of Protocol Consultants and Officers.]
+ Standards are important so that people can create products and systems that can interoperate.
+ Access technologies can be classified as follows.
  / Home access: digital subscriber line (DSL), cable Internet access, fiber to the home (FTTH), 5G fixed wireless, Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
  / Enterprise access: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
  / Wide-area wireless access: 3G, LTE 4G, 5G.
+ HFC transmission rate is shared among users. Collisions are not possible as it is a shared broad-cast medium.
+ Below are a few examples.

+ Users typically have 100 Mbps to tens of Gbps.
+ Some examples are twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable, and optical fiber.
+ The table below shows transmission rates according to some standards for HFC and DSL. In the case of FTTH, the transmission rate is potentially several Gbps fast.

+ Cellular network technologies (3G and LTE 4G and 5G) and Wi-Fi seem the most popular ones today. From the user's perspective, the biggest difference would be the range. With a cellular network, a user need only be within a few tens of kilometers of the base station, whereas with Wi-Fi, they have to be within a few tens of meters of the access point.
+ $L(1/R_1+1/R_2)$.
+ Dircuit-switching is better than packet-switching in that it establishes an end-to-end connection between the hosts, in which the transmission rate is guaranteed constant. In a circuit-switched network, every circuit of TDM has the same transmission rate, which might make TDM a better choice than FDM.
