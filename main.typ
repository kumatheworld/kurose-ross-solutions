+ Standards are important so that people can create products and systems that can interoperate.
+ Access technologies can be classified as follows.
  / Home access: digital subscriber line (DSL), cable Internet access, fiber to the home (FTTH), 5G fixed wireless, Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
  / Enterprise access: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
  / Wide-area wireless access: 3G, LTE 4G, 5G.
+ HFC transmission rate is shared among users. Collisions are not possible as it is a shared broad- cast medium.
+ Below are a few examples.
