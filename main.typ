+ A host and an end system are the same thing. Phones or laptops connected to the Internet are examples of end systems. A Web server is also an end system.

+ Standards are important so that people can create products and systems that can interoperate.
+ Access technologies can be classified as follows.
  / Home access: digital subscriber line (DSL), cable Internet access, fiber to the home (FTTH), 5G fixed wireless, Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
  / Enterprise access: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
  / Wide-area wireless access: 3G, LTE 4G, 5G.
+ HFC transmission rate is shared among users. Collisions are not possible as it is a shared broadcast medium.

+ Cellular network technologies (3G and LTE 4G and 5G) and Wi-Fi seem the most popular ones today. From the user's perspective, the biggest difference would be the range. With a cellular network, a user need only be within a few tens of kilometers of the base station, whereas with Wi-Fi, they have to be within a few tens of meters of the access point.
+ $L(1/R_1+1/R_2)$.
+ Dircuit-switching is better than packet-switching in that it establishes an end-to-end connection between the hosts, in which the transmission rate is guaranteed constant. In a circuit-switched network, every circuit of TDM has the same transmission rate, which might make TDM a better choice than FDM.
+
  + 2 Mbps / (1 Mbps / user) = 2 users
  + We can see from the above that a queuing delay can occur if and only if more than 2 users transmit simultaneously.
  + 20% = 0.2 as given.
  + The queue grows if and only if all three users are transmitting simultaneously, the probability of which is $(0.2)^3=0.008$.
+ Two ISPs at the same level of the hierarchy will often peer with each other because it is typically settlement-free as opposed to paying the upstream ISPs. IXPs earn money by charging the traffic exchanged by the downstream access ISPs.
+ Google has many data centers all over the world interconnected via their private TCP/IP network, separate from the public Internet. The network is connected with tier-1 ISPs as well as peering with lower-tier ISPs. By creating its own network, a content provider not only reduces its payments to upper-tier ISPs but also has greater control over how its services are ultimately delivered to end users.
+ The nodal delays consist of the processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and propagation delay. The queuing delay is variable as it depends on how many packets are sent to each link. The other three are constant given that the packet length and transmission rates are fixed.
+ Length, Rate and Packet size are shown as configurable parameters on the website. When (Length, Rate, Packet size) = (10 km, 100 Mbps, 100 Bytes), the sender finishes transmitting before the first bit of the packet reaches the receiver. When (Length, Rate, Packet size) = (10 km, 1 Mbps, 100 Bytes), the first bit of the packet reaches the receiver before the sender finishes transmitting.
+ In general, given $L$ [bytes], $d$ [m], $s$ [m/s], and $R$ [bit/s], the transmission delay and propagation delay are $8L\/R$ [s] and $d\/s$ [s] respectively. The transmission delay depends on both the packet length and the transmission rate, but the propagation delay doesn't depend on either of them. When $L=1,000$, $d=2,500times 10^3$, $s=2.5times 10^8$, and $R=2times 10^6$, it takes $8dot 1,000\/(2dot 10^6)+(2,500dot 10^3)\/(2.5times 10^8)=0.004+0.01=0.014$ seconds to propagate.
+
  + $min(R_1,R_2,R_3)=500$ kbps.
  + $8dot 4dot 10^6\/(500dot 10^3)=64$ seconds.
  + The throughput will be $min(R_1,R_2,R_3)=100$ kbps. It will take $64dot 500\/100=320$ seconds to transfer the file.
+ End system A creates packets by dividing the file and attaching to each chunk an IP header including the source and destination IP addresses. The router uses the destination IP address to determine the link onto which the packet is forwarded. Packet switching in the Internet is analogous to driving from one city to another and asking directions along the way because the end-to-end route is determined on the fly rather than ahead of time.
+ The maximum emission rate is 500 packets/s and the minimum transmission rate is 350 packets/s. With those rates, the traffic intensity is the ratio $500\/350=1.43$. It takes about 9.5 mses for packet loss to occur. Repeating the experiment gives you the same amount of time for packet loss to occur because packets arrive periodically.
+ Skipped for now.
+ The five layers are as follows, from the top to the bottom:
  - *Application layer* is where network applications and their application-layer protocols reside.
  - *Transport layer* transports application-layer messages between application endpoints.
  - *Network layer* moves datagrams from one host to another, determining the route between them.
  - *Link layer* moves frames from one node to the next along the route from one host to another.
  - *Physical layer* moves the individual bits within frames from one node to the next.
+ Those are what a packet is called in each layer.
+ A router processes the network layer. A link-layer switch processes the link layer. A host processes all five layers.
+ A self-replicating malware is malicious software that continues to infect hosts through the Internet from an already infected host.
+ A botnet can be created by forming a network of infected hosts. The attacker can then have the compromised hosts blast traffic at the target.

+ $d#sub[end-to-end]=(N+P-1)L/R$ as it takes $N L/R$ to send one packet and adding another from the rest $P-1$ packets will each take an additional $L/R$ by pipelining.
+
  + A circuit-switched network would be more appropriate for this application as it would have to establish a connection repeatedly with packet switching.
  + No form of congestion control is needed as all the packets will travel across the network without any queuing delay.
+ 
  + There are $4dot 4=16$ links and there can be as many connections when every connection is made between neighboring nodes.
  + $4plus 4$ connections can be made, each by way of either switch $B$ or $D$.
  + Yes we can by establishing 2 connections on each of the following paths: ABC, ADC, BAD, and BCD.
+ Since the assumption in the analogy that tollbooths are located every 100km is not consistent with this problem, we instead assume that the first and third tollbooths are 175km away, having the second one somewhere in between. We also assume that each tollbooth services a car at a rate of one car per 12 seconds as in the former setting of the analogy.
  + The transmission delay is $3dot 10dot 12$ seconds $=6$ minutes. The propagation delay is $175\/100$ hours $=105$ minutes. Therefore, the end-to-end delay is $6+105=111$ minutes long.
  + The transmission delay is now $3dot 8dot 12$ seconds $=4.8$ minutes, whereas the propagation delay remains the same. Thus the total delay is $4.8+105=109.8$ minutes long.
+
  + $d#sub[prop]=m\/s$.
  + $d#sub[trans]=L\/R$.
  + $d#sub[end-to-end]=d#sub[prop]+d#sub[trnas]=m\/s+L\/R$.
  + It is at the A-side end of the link.
  + It is at the B-side end of the link.
  + It is somewhere between the two ends of the link. 
  + $m=s dot L\/R=2.5dot 10^5 "[km/sec]"dot 8dot 1500 "bits"\/(10dot 10^6 "bps")=300$ km.
+ We have 3 kinds of delays to consider:
  - The conversion delay $d#sub[conv]$, which we define as the time needed to convert the rest of the bits including the bit we are interested in. If it is the $n$-th bit in the packet counting from the back where $1<=n<=448$ is an integer, $d#sub[conv]=n\/(64 "kbps")=0.016n$ [msec].
  - The transmission delay $d#sub[trans]=56 "bytes" \/(10 "Mbps")=0.0448$ msec.
  - The propagation delay $d#sub[prop]=10$ msec.
  Therefore, the overall delay is $d#sub[conv]+d#sub[trans]+d#sub[prop]=0.016n+10.448$ msec. The first bit ($n=448$) has a delay of 17.45 msec and the last bit ($n=1$) has a delay of 10.46 msec.
+
  + $10 "[Mbps]"\/(200 "[kbps]/user")=50$ users can be supported.
  + 10 percent as given.
  + $vec(120,n)dot 9^(120-n)\/10^120$.
  + $sum_(n=51)^120 vec(120,n)dot 9^(120-n)\/10^120=2.1dot 10^(-20)$.
+
  + $N=1 "[Gbps]"\/(100 "[kbps]")=10,000$.
  + $sum_(n=N+1)^M vec(M,n)dot p^n (1-p)^(M-n)$ or equivalently, $sum_(n=1)^N vec(M,n)dot p^(M-n) (1-p)^n$.
+ The processing, transmission, and propagation delay are $2d#sub[proc]$, $L sum_(i=1)^3 1\/R_i$, and $sum_(i=1)^3 d_i\/s_i$, respectively. Therefore, the total end-to-end delay $d#sub[end-to-end]$ is the sum $2d#sub[proc]+L sum_(i=1)^3 1\/R_i+sum_(i=1)^3 d_i\/s_i$. For those values given, $d#sub[end-to-end]=2dot 3 "msec"+3dot 1,500 "bytes"\/(2.5 "Mbps")+(5,000+4,000+1,000) "km"\/(2.5dot 10^8 "m/s")=(6+14.4+40) "msec"=60.4$ msec.
+ The processing, transmission, and propagation delay are 0, $L\/R$, and $sum_(i=1)^3 d_i\/s_i$, respectively. Therefore, the total end-to-end delay is the sum $L\/R+sum_(i=1)^3 d_i\/s_i$.
+ The queuing delay $d#sub[queue]$ is given by $d#sub[queue]=(n L-x)\/R$, being equal to the transmission delay of the bits ahead. For those values given, we have $d#sub[queue]=4.5dot 1,500 "bytes"\/(2.5 "Mbps")=21.6$ msec.
+ 
  + The $n$-th packet has the queuing delay $(n-1)L\/R$ as the transmission delay of the $(n-1)$ packets ahead. Therefore, the average queuing delay is $(sum_(n=1)^N (n-1)L\/R)\/N=(N-1)L\/2R$.
  + Since $L N\/R$ is long enough to transmit $N$ packets, the average queuing delay is the same as above $(N-1)L\/2R$.
+
  + The queuing and transmission delay are $I L\/R(1-I)$ and $L\/R$ respectively. Therefore, the total delay $d$ is the sum $d=I L\/R(1-I)+L\/R=L\/R(1-I)$.
  + Let $r=L\/R$. The total delay $d=L\/R(1-I)=r\/(1-a r)$ as a function of $r$ looks like the following. Here we set $a=5$, but the shape of the curve will remain the same with other values as well.
  #image("data/c1p14b.png")
+ $I=a\/mu$ holds. Hence the total delay is $L\/R(1-I)=I\/(1-I)a=1\/(mu-a)$.
+ From Little's formula, it holds that $a=N\/(d#sub[trans]+d#sub[queue])$, where $d#sub[trans]$ and $d#sub[queue]$ are the transmission and queuing delay, respectively. With those values given, we have $d#sub[trans]=1\/(100 "packets/sec")=10$ msec/packet, $d#sub[queue]=20 "msec/packet"$, and $a=100\/((10+20) "msec/packet")=3.33$ packets/msec.
+
  + It holds that $d#sub[end-to-end]=sum_i^N (d_"proc"^i+d_"trans"^i+d_"prop"^i)$, where $d_"proc"^i$, $d_"trans"^i$, and $d_"prop"^i$ are $i$-th router's processing, transmission, and propagation delay, respectively.
  + $d#sub[end-to-end]=(N-1)d_"queue"+sum_i^N (d_"proc"^i+d_"trans"^i+d_"prop"^i)$.
+ See #link("data/c1p18.sh") and #link("data/c1p18.txt") for reference.
  + 15.22 #sym.plus.minus 0.23 ms, 15.30 #sym.plus.minus 0.62 ms, and 14.05 #sym.plus.minus 0.07 ms.
  + The paths and the number of routers did not change.
  + There are at least 3 ISP networks, namely ntlworld.ie, aorta.net, and Google. The largest delay occurred within Google's network.
  + The traceroute program does not show the hops close to the destination, but the farthest routers show values around 110ms, which should be close to the actual end-to-end RTT to the destination. The path changed slightly within the gw.umass.edu network. There are at least 3 ISP networks, namely ntlworld.ie, aorta.net, and gtt.net. The largest delay occurred within gtt.net, which was between ae6.cr0-dub2.ip4.gtt.net and et-0-0-5.cr1-bos1.ip4.gtt.net. Those intra-continental and inter-continental results show that the latter was an order of magnitude slower due to the inter-continental link.
+ $n(n-1)$ messages will be sent. Yes, it does support Metcalfe's law.
+ $min{R_s,R_c,R\/M}$.
+ If the server can only use one path to send data to the client, the maximum throughput is $max_(k=1,dots,M)min_(i=1,dots,n)R_i^k$. If the server can use all $M$ paths to send data, the maximum throughput is $sum_(k=1)^M min_(i=1,dots,n)R_i^k$.
+ The probability that a packet sent by the server is successfully received by the receiver is $(1-p)^N$. On average, the server will re-transmit the packet as many times as $sum_(i=0)^infinity i(1-(1-p)^N)^i (1-p)^N=1\/(1-p)^N-1$. The formula diverges to infinity if $p=1$, showing that retransmissions continue indefinitely.
+
  + It is $L\/R_s$, which is the bigger of the two transmission delays since there will be no queuing at the router.
  + The second packet queues if and only if the transmission delay $L\/R_c$ of the first packet at the router is bigger than $L\/R_s+d#sub[prop]$, which is the time it takes for the second packet to reach the router. If that is the case, the second packet will have to wait for $T=L\/R_c-L\/R_s-d#sub[prop]$ seconds to ensure no queuing.
